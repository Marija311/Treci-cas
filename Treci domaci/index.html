        <p class="paragraph">at place des Vosges</p>
        <p>L'Ambroisie (French pronunciation: ​[lɑ̃bʁwazi]) is a traditional French restaurant in Paris, France founded by Bernard Pacaud and now run by his son Mathieu that has maintained three Michelin stars for more than thirty years. The name "L'Ambroisie" ("Ambrosia" in English) comes from Greek mythology and means both "food for gods" and "source of immortality."

        The restaurant is in a period house on the southwestern corner of the Place des Vosges in Paris. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Place des Vosges was an upper-class and noble neighborhood.
